# Predictive Maintenance
 This script is designed for predictive maintenance by calculating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of engines based on sensor data. It performs data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model training using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors. The script includes steps for:  Loading Datasets: Importing data from local files.  Data Cleaning: Handling missing values by forward filling and removing constant features.  Feature Engineering: Scaling sensor data to the range [0, 1] and calculating RUL.  Model Training: Splitting the data into training and validation sets, and training a Random Forest model to predict RUL.  Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using RMSE and visualizing predictions and feature importance.  Model Saving: Saving the trained Random Forest model using joblib for later use.  Additionally, optional visualizations are provided to analyze data trends, sensor readings, and feature correlations, helping to gain insights into the model's performance and the data's characteristics.
